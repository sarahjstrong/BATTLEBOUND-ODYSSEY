## **WELCOME TO THE FANTASY BATTLE GAME!**
**Instructions:** The Fantasy Battle Game requires 2 players. Player 1 will use
the command-line to choose a character and enter their details. Next, player two
will do the same. Then the game begins...

**Character Type Backgrounds:** Each character types serves to add a little creativity
to the game. It doesn't impact the character stats much put it does give you ONE power 
specific to that character type that allows you to inflict more damage on the opponent
defend themself, or even manipulate your character into skipping a turn! By default, each
character has the ability to perform all the following abilities ONLY ONCE:
* **Full Heal:** Returns character health to 50 (perfect health)
* **Partial Heal:** Adds 10 to character health
* **Power Attack:** Adds 10 to attack
* **Special Attack:** This is specific to character type, but can only be used once.

**Elf:** Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not 
entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient 
forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts 
through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic,
art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

**Dragonborn:** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly 
through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods
or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique
race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful 
servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still 
others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
Dwarf: Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, 
the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan
and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all
dwarves.

**Gnome:** A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where
gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch 
of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and 
especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of 
invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

**Half-Elf:** Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what
some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, invent
iveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic 
tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional 
and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches
them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the 
timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, 
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with 
other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

**Halfling:** The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to 
settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing
fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live
out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that 
travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders
of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home,
though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

*Half-Orc:** Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to 
a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human communities, sometimes form 
alliances. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some
half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities. Some venture into the world
to prove their worth. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their
mighty deeds.

**Human:** In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, 
late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and 
dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as
much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to
prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation
of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, 
and the pioneers of the worlds.

**Tiefling:** To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street,
to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife,
tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of 
Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature
are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and
their children’s children will always be held accountable.
