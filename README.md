## **WELCOME TO BATTLEBOUND ODYSSEY!**


Welcome to BattleBound Odyssey, an exciting Java-based project that explores the realm of object-oriented programming 
and the command-line interface. This project showcases the implementation of a turn-based game where multiple users can 
engage in battles, each controlling a unique character with special powers and varying abilities.

### Overview

BattleBound Odyssey is a command-line game written in Java that leverages the principles of object-oriented programming to 
create a clear and modular structure. The project emphasizes the use of a character superclass, defining nine distinct character 
types, each with a special power implemented through an overridden method. The game's core logic is encapsulated in the battle class,
managing players and executing game actions during each turn.

### Features
* Object-Oriented Design: Explore the world of object-oriented programming with a well-organized structure.

* Character Superclass: Utilize a character superclass to define nine unique character types, each with a special power implemented 
through method overrides, varying starting health, and a range of character abilities.

* Command-Line Interface: Interact with the game through the command line, providing a straightforward user experience.

* Loosely Coupled Code: Split entities into different classes with methods that are independent of one another
with the goal of practicing loosely coupled code.



**Instructions:** The Fantasy Battle Game requires 2 players. Player 1 will use
the command-line interface to choose a character and enter their details. Next, player two
will do the same. To choose a character type, make sure you enter a number based on 
the list presented. For your character name, this can be anything. Get creative!

It is recommended that you keep your caps lock on during gameplay. To move forward during
 your turn, you will be asked to enter a character like "Y" to continue and "PA" (power attack)
 and other characters to perform your abilities. Before each turn, you will be presented 
with your list of abilities that remain. You can select from that list or enter "N" to
 continue to your roll. If you use a special ability, you will ALSO get to roll afterward. The
 game keeps track of rounds, so you will know which round you are currently on. Each round consists
of player one's turn followed by player two's. These rounds continue until a player's health reaches zero.
 The game will display the winning character at the end!

Enjoy the game and most importantly, GOOD LUCK!

Read below about the different character types.

**Character Type Backgrounds:** Each character type serves to add a little creativity
to the game. Each character model is similar but have varying full health, differing strength of abilities,
and a UNIQUE special power. This special power is unique to that character type and allows you to inflict
more damage on the opponent, defend yourself, or even manipulate opponent into skipping a turn! By default, each
character has the ability to perform all the following abilities ONLY ONCE:
* **Full Heal:** Returns character health to perfect health (Full health points vary by character type)
* **Partial Heal:** Increases health by a certain number (specific to character type)
* **Power Attack:** Adds anywhere from 8 to 15 points to next attack
* **Special Attack:** This is specific to character type, but can only be used once. Try playing
multiple rounds with each character to discover their unique powers!

**Elf (full health 50 | larger partial heal):** Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not 
entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient 
forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts 
through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic,
art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

**Dragonborn (full health 60):** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly 
through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods
or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique
race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful 
servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still 
others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
Dwarf: Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, 
the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan
and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all
dwarves.

**Gnome (full health 50 | stronger power attack):** A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where
gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch 
of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and 
especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of 
invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

**Half-Elf (full health 50 | larger partial heal):** Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what
some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, invent
iveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic 
tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional 
and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches
them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the 
timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, 
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with 
other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

**Halfling (full health 50 | larger partial heal):** The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to 
settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing
fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live
out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that 
travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders
of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home,
though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

**Half-Orc (full health 60):** Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to 
a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human communities, sometimes form 
alliances. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some
half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities. Some venture into the world
to prove their worth. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their
mighty deeds.

**Human (full health 45 | stronger abilities):** In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, 
late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and 
dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as
much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to
prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation
of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, 
and the pioneers of the worlds.

**Tiefling (full health 60):** To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street,
to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife,
tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of 
Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature
are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and
their children’s children will always be held accountable.
